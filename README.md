# dumb
With the massive daily increase of useless scripts on Genius's web frontend, and having to download megabytes of clutter, [dumb](https://github.com/rramiachraf/dumb) tries to make reading lyrics from Genius a pleasant experience, and as lightweight as possible.

## Installation & Usage
### Docker
```bash
docker run -p 8080:5555 --name dumb ghcr.io/rramiachraf/dumb:latest
```

### Build from source
[Go 1.22+](https://go.dev/dl) is required.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rramiachraf/dumb
cd dumb
make build
./dumb
```

#### Notes:
- The default port is 5555, you can use other ports by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
- Genius servers are behind a Cloudflare reverse proxy, which means certain IPs won't be able to send requests, to partially mitigate this, you can specify a proxy by setting the `PROXY` variable (must be a valid URI).
